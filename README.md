# Multi-Trait-Pool-GWAS-Methods
This repository contains the `R` scripts written to perform Pool GWAS for a two dimensional trait. It implements the methodology proposed in our article **'Pool-GWAS methods for multiple complex traits'** and applies it to simulated data. The script `MultiTrait_PoolGWAS.R` contains the codes to implement our method for one instance of simulated phenotype. The other script `MultiTrait_PoolGWAS_Sim.R` contains the codes of our simulation studies, where we have simulated $100$ different instances of phenotype. This is a sample script and corresponds to only one case of our simulation where we took $16$ clusters (pools) and Original Stability Selection was applied with $\tau=0.8$ and $PFER=0.5$. The script for simulation does not contain any explanation. For detailed explanation of the R codes and functions used, please see the former script.
